Crispy pork is pretty much perfect in any form, but this isn&#x2019;t your run-of-the-mill schnitzel. To amp up flavor, we&#x2019;ve added lemon zest and garlic powder to our breadcrumb mixture, then drizzled the crispy pork chops with our new favorite condiment: creamy honey mustard sauce. Speaking of, we&#x2019;re serving up sides of roasted potatoes and carrots for extra dipping, but if you broke out the spoon to scrape up leftover sauce, we wouldn&#x2019;t judge.">
