	description: Craving a rich pasta dish but also a bounty of veggies? Thanks to this recipe, you donâ€™t have to choose between the two. Here, youâ€™ll find al dente penne pasta, green peas, and roasted bell pepper and zucchini, all tossed in a creamy, dreamy sauce thatâ€™s brightened with lemon juice and made aromatic with Italian herbs. Each plate is showered with grated Parmesan for an im-pasta-bly delicious dinner.

	name: Sweet & Smoky Pork Filet
	description: If youâ€™re craving something thatâ€™s good and hearty, this recipe has got you covered. Pork filet is rubbed with cinnamon and smoked paprika, which brings a layer of warm aromatics to the meat. Itâ€™s then roasted and drizzled in a cherry jam sauce that adds sweetness to all that savory. The mashed potatoes on the side stay creamy and classic, but there are also tender roasted carrots with a sprinkle of chili flakes for a pop of heat.
